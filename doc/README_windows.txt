DMS Core
==========

Intro
-----
The main task of Documentchain is to store document information for a tamper-proof 
document revision. DMS is the project-own coin used to pay the storage fees.

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run dms-qt.exe.

DMS Core is the original Documentchain client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

See the documentation at:

for more help and information.
