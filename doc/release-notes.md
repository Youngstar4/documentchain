Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/DMS-Qt (on Mac) or
dmsd/dms-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade using version < 0.13.4 "Judy" 
or after DIP020 activation using any version < 0.17.0.3 "Kenji"
you will have to reisync (see below).

Note the [blockchain download option](https://documentchain.org/support/bootstrap/) for quick synchronization.

Downgrade warning
-----------------

Downgrading to a older version is no longer supported.
